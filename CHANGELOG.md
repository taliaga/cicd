# CHANGELOG

I've seen four approaches to changelogs:

- Not having them at all
- (semi)Automatically created out of git commits
- (semi)Automatically created out of issue tracking system tickets
- Manually curated

I need to write about these experiences, but not now.
If you want a good guideline now, checkout https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/.
